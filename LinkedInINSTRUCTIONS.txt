This is the Instructions page to have the LinkedIn buttons redirect
to your (future) AkevaTechnologies LinkedIn page.

In index.html, about.html, services.html, contact.html (All 4 files)
You will each find a similar line:

    <a href="#" class="social-icon" aria-label="LinkedIn - Connect with Akeva Technologies"><i class="fab fa-linkedin" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

The href="#" indicates that it DOES NOT redirect to another page.
Simply change the # found inside the quotes to your LinkedIn link.

Example:

    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/misse-misse/" class="social-icon" aria-label="LinkedIn - Connect with Akeva Technologies"><i class="fab fa-linkedin" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

Now, it will redirect to your LinkedIn for example.
You must do this for all of the 4 files mentioned above.
